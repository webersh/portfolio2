      <a id="professional"></a>
      <p> I have five plus years working on the implementation and support side of healthcare software, specifically for the purposes of quality management and patient safety. In these roles, I saw firsthand how the technologies clinicians rely on can be cumbersome and not tailored to clinical settings. I'm interesting in applying user experience principles to make healthcare technologies blend effortlessly with clinical practice.</p><br>
      <p> As part of my graduate studies, I have also learned how to design for consumer and patient populations. Using behavior change theories, I work to design and develop products and applications that aim to influence and change an individual's health behavior and practices. Check out my projects page to see some of my recent work.

      <p>I am an East Coaster through and through who is adapting to the Midwest while attending the University of Michigan for graduate school. I have family roots on Cape Cod and in Switzerland, so I am comfortable on both water and snow.</p>
